A simple calculator app with the following functionality:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponents
- Square Root

GUI was made referencing the following documents:
- [Getting Started with Swing by Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/start/index.html)
- [How to Build a Desktop Application with Java by Seun Matt](https://medium.com/prodsters/how-to-build-a-desktop-application-with-java-a34ee9c18ee3)

## Possible Future Work
- Adding keyboard interaction
- Remaking with JavaFX as opposed to Swing
- Making buttons resizable
