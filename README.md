# Calculator app made with Java Swing

A simple calculator app with the following functionality:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponents
- Square Root

GUI was made referencing the following documents:
- [Getting Started with Swing by Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/start/index.html)
- [How to Build a Desktop Application with Java by Seun Matt](https://medium.com/prodsters/how-to-build-a-desktop-application-with-java-a34ee9c18ee3)

## To Run Application
1. Ensure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 downloaded. You can find it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/#jre8) if you don't have it already.
2. Download [calculator/Calculator.java](https://github.com/aro126/java-calculator-app/blob/master/calculator/Calculator.java)
3. Run `javac Calculator.java` from same directory as the file
4. Then run `java Calculator`

## Possible Future Work
- Adding keyboard interaction
- Remaking with JavaFX as opposed to Swing
- Making buttons resizable
